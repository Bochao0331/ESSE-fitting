"ESSE-fitting: echo-shifted spin-echo complex non-li" <br />
Example Raw data locate in: ** **; <br />
Example MAT files locate in: ** ** <br />

This script does reading, and non-linear least-sqaure fitting of 2D ES-SE data with different TE or GRE timing.<br />
**Need to be more improved by considering off-resoance and non-linear inversion**
